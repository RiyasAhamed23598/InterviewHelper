title: Working with Database Views in Entity Framework Core

## Interview Question
How to call a database view in EF Core?

## Answer
Entity Framework Core provides several ways to work with database views, allowing you to map them to entity types just like tables.

### 1. Mapping a View Using Entity Type Configuration

The most common approach is to create an entity class and map it to a view using the Fluent API:

```csharp
// Entity class representing the view
public class ProductSummary
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public string CategoryName { get; set; }
    public decimal UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public int UnitsInStock { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalValue { get; set; }
}

// DbContext configuration
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<ProductSummary> ProductSummaries { get; set; }
    
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        // Map the entity to a database view
        modelBuilder.Entity<ProductSummary>(entity =>
        {
            entity.HasNoKey(); // Views often don't have primary keys
            entity.ToView("vw_ProductSummary"); // Name of the view in the database
            
            // Optionally configure properties
            entity.Property(e => e.TotalValue).HasColumnType("money");
        });
    }
}
```

### 2. Creating the View in a Migration

You can create the view as part of your database migrations:

```csharp
public partial class CreateProductSummaryView : Migration
{
    protected override void Up(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.Sql(@"
            CREATE VIEW vw_ProductSummary AS
            SELECT 
                p.Id AS ProductId,
                p.Name AS ProductName,
                c.Name AS CategoryName,
                p.UnitPrice,
                p.UnitsInStock,
                p.UnitPrice * p.UnitsInStock AS TotalValue
            FROM Products p
            JOIN Categories c ON p.CategoryId = c.Id
        ");
    }

    protected override void Down(MigrationBuilder migrationBuilder)
    {
        migrationBuilder.Sql("DROP VIEW vw_ProductSummary");
    }
}
```

### 3. Using Raw SQL to Query a View

If you prefer not to create an entity for the view, you can use raw SQL:

```csharp
public async Task<List<ProductSummary>> GetProductSummariesAsync()
{
    return await _context.ProductSummaries
        .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM vw_ProductSummary")
        .ToListAsync();
}

// Or with parameters
public async Task<List<ProductSummary>> GetProductSummariesByCategoryAsync(string categoryName)
{
    return await _context.ProductSummaries
        .FromSqlRaw("SELECT * FROM vw_ProductSummary WHERE CategoryName = {0}", categoryName)
        .ToListAsync();
}
```

### 4. Using Keyless Entity Types for Views

For EF Core 5.0+, you can explicitly mark the entity as keyless:

```csharp
[Keyless]
public class ProductSummary
{
    public int ProductId { get; set; }
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public string CategoryName { get; set; }
    public decimal UnitPrice { get; set; }
    public int UnitsInStock { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalValue { get; set; }
}
```

## Key Points ðŸ’¡
- Database views provide a way to encapsulate complex queries
- Views can improve performance for frequently used complex queries
- EF Core supports mapping entities to views using the ToView() method
- Views are typically mapped as keyless entity types since they often lack primary keys
- You can use migrations to create and manage database views
- Views can be queried using LINQ just like regular tables
- Views are read-only in EF Core
- Consider using views for reporting and analytics scenarios
- Views can help abstract complex data relationships from your application code

## Common Follow-up Questions
1. What are the performance implications of using views versus direct queries?
2. How do you handle views with parameters in EF Core?
3. Can you update data through a view in EF Core?
4. How do you handle views that join multiple tables with different primary keys?
