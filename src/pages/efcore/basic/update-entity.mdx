title: Updating Entities in EF Core
---

## Interview Question
How can you update an existing entity in Entity Framework Core?

## Answer
There are several ways to update entities in EF Core. Here are the main approaches:

### 1. Track and Update
```csharp
using (var context = new ApplicationDbContext())
{
    var customer = await context.Customers.FindAsync(1);
    customer.Name = "Updated Name";
    await context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

### 2. Update Without Querying
```csharp
using (var context = new ApplicationDbContext())
{
    var customer = new Customer 
    { 
        Id = 1, 
        Name = "Updated Name" 
    };
    context.Customers.Update(customer);
    await context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

### 3. Updating Specific Properties
```csharp
using (var context = new ApplicationDbContext())
{
    var customer = new Customer { Id = 1 };
    context.Customers.Attach(customer);
    context.Entry(customer).Property(x => x.Name).IsModified = true;
    customer.Name = "Updated Name";
    await context.SaveChangesAsync();
}
```

## Key Points ðŸ’¡
- First approach is best when you need to validate existing data
- Second approach is efficient when you know the entity exists
- Third approach is best for partial updates
- Always consider concurrency handling

## Common Follow-up Questions
1. How do you handle concurrency conflicts?
2. What's the difference between Update and Attach?
3. How can you update multiple entities efficiently?
