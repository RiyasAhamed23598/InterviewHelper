title: Default lifetime of DbContext in DI
---

## Interview Question
What is the default lifetime of DbContext in Dependency Injection and why is it chosen as the default?

## Answer
The default lifetime of DbContext in Entity Framework Core is **Scoped**. This means:

- A new instance is created once per request in web applications
- The same instance is shared within that request
- Different requests get different instances

```csharp
// Default registration
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));

// Equivalent to:
builder.Services.AddDbContext<ApplicationDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString),
    ServiceLifetime.Scoped);
```

### Why Scoped is the Default Choice

1. **Resource Management**
   - Automatic cleanup after each request
   - Prevents memory leaks from entity tracking
   - Efficient connection management

2. **Thread Safety**
   - Each request has its own DbContext
   - Safe for parallel request processing
   - Prevents concurrent access issues

### Common Pitfall to Watch Out For

```csharp
// ‚ùå WRONG: Never inject DbContext into Singleton services
public class SingletonService
{
    private readonly ApplicationDbContext _context; // This will cause issues!
    
    public SingletonService(ApplicationDbContext context)
    {
        _context = context;
    }
}

// ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use scope creation in Singleton services
public class SingletonService
{
    private readonly IServiceProvider _serviceProvider;
    
    public SingletonService(IServiceProvider serviceProvider)
    {
        _serviceProvider = serviceProvider;
    }
    
    public async Task DoWorkAsync()
    {
        using var scope = _serviceProvider.CreateScope();
        var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ApplicationDbContext>();
        // Use context here
    }
}
```

## Interview Tips üí°
- Emphasize that Scoped lifetime aligns with web request lifecycle
- Mention the importance of proper disposal in long-running operations
- Be ready to explain why Singleton lifetime should be avoided
- Know how to handle DbContext in background services

## Common Follow-up Questions
1. How would you handle DbContext in a background service?
2. What are the implications of using Transient vs Scoped lifetime?
3. How do you properly dispose of DbContext when manually creating instances?
