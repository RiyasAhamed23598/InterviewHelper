# What is SQL and what are its main components?

## Answer

**SQL (Structured Query Language)** is a standardized programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a way to communicate with database management systems to perform various operations on data.

## Main Components of SQL

### 1. **DDL (Data Definition Language)**
Commands that define the database structure:
- `CREATE` - Creates database objects (tables, indexes, views)
- `ALTER` - Modifies existing database objects
- `DROP` - Deletes database objects
- `TRUNCATE` - Removes all records from a table

```sql
-- Example DDL commands
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);

DROP TABLE employees;
```

### 2. **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**
Commands that manipulate data within tables:
- `SELECT` - Retrieves data from tables
- `INSERT` - Adds new records
- `UPDATE` - Modifies existing records
- `DELETE` - Removes records

```sql
-- Example DML commands
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 40000;

UPDATE employees SET salary = 55000 WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
```

### 3. **DCL (Data Control Language)**
Commands that control access to data:
- `GRANT` - Gives user access privileges
- `REVOKE` - Removes user access privileges

```sql
-- Example DCL commands
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON employees TO user1;

REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM user1;
```

### 4. **TCL (Transaction Control Language)**
Commands that manage database transactions:
- `COMMIT` - Saves transaction changes
- `ROLLBACK` - Undoes transaction changes
- `SAVEPOINT` - Creates a point within a transaction
- `SET TRANSACTION` - Sets transaction properties

```sql
-- Example TCL commands
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (2, 'Jane Smith', 60000);
SAVEPOINT sp1;
UPDATE employees SET salary = 65000 WHERE id = 2;
ROLLBACK TO sp1;
COMMIT;
```

## Key Features of SQL

1. **Declarative Language**: You specify what you want, not how to get it
2. **Standardized**: ANSI/ISO standard with vendor-specific extensions
3. **Portable**: Works across different database systems
4. **Powerful**: Handles complex queries and data operations
5. **Scalable**: Efficient for both small and large datasets

## Common SQL Database Systems

- **MySQL** - Open-source, widely used for web applications
- **PostgreSQL** - Advanced open-source with extensive features
- **Microsoft SQL Server** - Enterprise-grade database system
- **Oracle Database** - High-performance enterprise solution
- **SQLite** - Lightweight, embedded database

## Interview Tips

- Understand that SQL is both a language and a standard
- Know the four main categories of SQL commands
- Be familiar with basic syntax and common operations
- Understand that different database systems may have slight variations
- Practice writing basic queries for each command type
