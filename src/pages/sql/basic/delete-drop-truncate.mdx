# What is the difference between DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE?

## Answer

DELETE, DROP, and TRUNCATE are SQL commands that remove data, but they operate at different levels and have distinct characteristics.

## DELETE Command

**Purpose**: Removes specific rows from a table based on conditions.

### Characteristics:
- **DML command** - Data Manipulation Language
- **Row-level operation** - Can delete specific rows
- **Conditional** - Uses WHERE clause for filtering
- **Transactional** - Can be rolled back
- **Triggers** - Fires DELETE triggers
- **Slower** - Logs each row deletion

```sql
-- Delete specific rows
DELETE FROM employees WHERE department = 'Marketing';

-- Delete all rows (but keeps table structure)
DELETE FROM employees;

-- Delete with JOIN
DELETE e FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.dept_name = 'Closed Department';

-- Transaction example
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE salary < 30000;
-- Can be rolled back
ROLLBACK;
```

## DROP Command

**Purpose**: Removes entire database objects (tables, databases, indexes, etc.).

### Characteristics:
- **DDL command** - Data Definition Language
- **Object-level operation** - Removes entire structure
- **Complete removal** - Data and structure both deleted
- **Auto-commit** - Cannot be rolled back (usually)
- **Cascading** - May affect dependent objects
- **Fastest** - No logging of individual rows

```sql
-- Drop entire table
DROP TABLE employees;

-- Drop database
DROP DATABASE company_db;

-- Drop with CASCADE (removes dependent objects)
DROP TABLE departments CASCADE;

-- Drop if exists (prevents errors)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_table;
```

## TRUNCATE Command

**Purpose**: Removes all rows from a table quickly while preserving structure.

### Characteristics:
- **DDL command** - Data Definition Language
- **Table-level operation** - Removes all rows at once
- **No conditions** - Cannot use WHERE clause
- **Fast** - Deallocates data pages
- **Resets identity** - Resets auto-increment counters
- **Limited rollback** - Usually cannot be rolled back

```sql
-- Remove all rows quickly
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;

-- Cannot use WHERE clause
-- TRUNCATE TABLE employees WHERE dept_id = 1; -- ERROR

-- Resets auto-increment
TRUNCATE TABLE orders; -- Next insert will start from 1 again
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | DELETE | DROP | TRUNCATE |
|--------|--------|------|----------|
| **Command Type** | DML | DDL | DDL |
| **Operation Level** | Row-level | Object-level | Table-level |
| **Conditions** | WHERE clause | N/A | No conditions |
| **Rollback** | Yes | Usually No | Usually No |
| **Speed** | Slowest | Fastest | Fast |
| **Triggers** | Fires triggers | N/A | No triggers |
| **Structure** | Preserved | Removed | Preserved |
| **Identity Reset** | No | N/A | Yes |

## Practical Examples

### Sample Table Setup
```sql
CREATE TABLE test_employees (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO test_employees (name, department) VALUES 
('John Doe', 'IT'),
('Jane Smith', 'HR'),
('Mike Johnson', 'IT'),
('Sarah Wilson', 'Finance');
```

### DELETE Examples
```sql
-- Delete specific records
DELETE FROM test_employees WHERE department = 'IT';
-- Result: Removes John Doe and Mike Johnson, keeps table structure

-- Delete all records
DELETE FROM test_employees;
-- Result: Empty table, but structure remains, next insert ID continues sequence
```

### TRUNCATE Examples
```sql
-- Remove all data quickly
TRUNCATE TABLE test_employees;
-- Result: Empty table, structure remains, auto-increment resets to 1
```

### DROP Examples
```sql
-- Remove entire table
DROP TABLE test_employees;
-- Result: Table no longer exists, all data and structure gone
```

## Performance Comparison

```sql
-- Scenario: Remove all data from a large table (1 million rows)

-- DELETE - Slowest (logs each row deletion)
DELETE FROM large_table; -- Takes several minutes

-- TRUNCATE - Fast (deallocates pages)
TRUNCATE TABLE large_table; -- Takes seconds

-- DROP - Fastest (removes entire object)
DROP TABLE large_table; -- Nearly instantaneous
```

## Use Cases

### Use DELETE when:
- Removing specific rows based on conditions
- Need to maintain referential integrity
- Want to trigger DELETE triggers
- Need transaction rollback capability
- Working with small datasets

### Use TRUNCATE when:
- Removing all rows from a table
- Need to reset auto-increment counters
- Performance is critical
- Don't need to fire triggers
- Table has no foreign key references

### Use DROP when:
- Removing entire table permanently
- Table is no longer needed
- Cleaning up temporary tables
- Removing test or staging tables

## Constraints and Limitations

### DELETE Limitations:
```sql
-- Can be slow on large tables
DELETE FROM million_row_table; -- Very slow

-- May cause lock escalation
DELETE FROM busy_table WHERE condition; -- May block other operations
```

### TRUNCATE Limitations:
```sql
-- Cannot use WHERE clause
-- TRUNCATE TABLE employees WHERE dept_id = 1; -- ERROR

-- Cannot truncate table with foreign key references
-- TRUNCATE TABLE departments; -- ERROR if employees references it
```

### DROP Limitations:
```sql
-- Cannot drop table with dependent objects (without CASCADE)
-- DROP TABLE departments; -- ERROR if foreign keys reference it

-- Permanent operation (usually cannot be undone)
DROP TABLE important_data; -- Gone forever (unless backed up)
```

## Recovery Considerations

```sql
-- DELETE - Can be recovered from transaction log
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = 1;
ROLLBACK; -- Data recovered

-- TRUNCATE - Limited recovery options
TRUNCATE TABLE employees; -- Usually cannot rollback

-- DROP - Requires backup restoration
DROP TABLE employees; -- Must restore from backup
```

## Interview Tips

- Remember: DELETE removes rows, TRUNCATE removes all rows, DROP removes everything
- Know that DELETE is DML (transactional), while TRUNCATE and DROP are DDL
- Understand performance implications of each command
- Be aware of when each command can or cannot be rolled back
- Practice scenarios where each command is most appropriate
