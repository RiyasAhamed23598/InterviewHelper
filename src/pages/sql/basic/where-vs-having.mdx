# What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clauses?

## Answer

Both WHERE and HAVING clauses are used to filter data in SQL, but they operate at different stages of query execution and serve different purposes.

## WHERE Clause

**Purpose**: Filters rows **before** grouping and aggregation occurs.

### Characteristics:
- Applied to individual rows
- Cannot use aggregate functions
- Executed before GROUP BY
- More efficient for large datasets

```sql
-- Example table
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id INT,
    salesperson VARCHAR(50),
    region VARCHAR(50),
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    sale_date DATE
);

-- WHERE clause examples
SELECT * FROM sales 
WHERE amount > 1000;

SELECT * FROM sales 
WHERE region = 'North' AND sale_date >= '2024-01-01';

SELECT salesperson, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales 
WHERE region = 'North'  -- Filter rows before grouping
GROUP BY salesperson;
```

## HAVING Clause

**Purpose**: Filters groups **after** grouping and aggregation occurs.

### Characteristics:
- Applied to grouped results
- Can use aggregate functions
- Executed after GROUP BY
- Used with GROUP BY clause

```sql
-- HAVING clause examples
SELECT salesperson, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales 
GROUP BY salesperson
HAVING SUM(amount) > 5000;  -- Filter groups after aggregation

SELECT region, COUNT(*) as sale_count, AVG(amount) as avg_amount
FROM sales 
GROUP BY region
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10 AND AVG(amount) > 1500;
```

## Key Differences

| Aspect | WHERE | HAVING |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Applied to** | Individual rows | Grouped results |
| **Execution order** | Before GROUP BY | After GROUP BY |
| **Aggregate functions** | Cannot use | Can use |
| **Performance** | Generally faster | Slower (processes groups) |
| **Usage** | Row-level filtering | Group-level filtering |

## Execution Order

```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition1          -- 1. Filter rows first
GROUP BY column1          -- 2. Group the filtered rows
HAVING condition2         -- 3. Filter the groups
ORDER BY column1;         -- 4. Sort the final result
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Sales Analysis
```sql
-- Find salespeople in the North region who have total sales > $10,000
SELECT salesperson, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales 
WHERE region = 'North'              -- Filter rows: only North region
GROUP BY salesperson 
HAVING SUM(amount) > 10000;         -- Filter groups: total sales > $10,000
```

### Example 2: Customer Orders
```sql
-- Find customers who placed more than 5 orders with individual order value > $100
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) as order_count, AVG(order_amount) as avg_order
FROM orders 
WHERE order_amount > 100            -- Filter: only orders > $100
GROUP BY customer_id 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;                -- Filter: customers with > 5 orders
```

### Example 3: Product Categories
```sql
-- Find product categories with average price > $50 and more than 3 products
SELECT category, COUNT(*) as product_count, AVG(price) as avg_price
FROM products 
WHERE status = 'active'             -- Filter: only active products
GROUP BY category 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 AND AVG(price) > 50;  -- Filter: categories meeting criteria
```

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Wrong: Using aggregate functions in WHERE
```sql
-- This will cause an error
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
WHERE COUNT(*) > 5  -- ERROR: Cannot use aggregate in WHERE
GROUP BY department;
```

### ✅ Correct: Using aggregate functions in HAVING
```sql
SELECT department, COUNT(*) 
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;  -- Correct: Use HAVING for aggregates
```

### ❌ Wrong: Using HAVING without GROUP BY for non-aggregates
```sql
-- This works but is inefficient
SELECT * FROM employees 
HAVING salary > 50000;  -- Should use WHERE instead
```

### ✅ Correct: Using WHERE for non-aggregates
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000;  -- More efficient
```

## Performance Considerations

### WHERE is more efficient:
```sql
-- Better performance - filters early
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date >= '2020-01-01'  -- Reduces rows before grouping
GROUP BY department;
```

### HAVING processes more data:
```sql
-- Less efficient - processes all rows first
SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees 
GROUP BY department 
HAVING MIN(hire_date) >= '2020-01-01';  -- Filters after grouping
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use WHERE for row filtering** - Filter individual rows before grouping
2. **Use HAVING for group filtering** - Filter aggregated results
3. **Combine both when needed** - WHERE first, then HAVING
4. **Consider performance** - WHERE is generally faster than HAVING
5. **Be specific** - Use the most restrictive filters in WHERE clause

## Interview Tips

- Remember: WHERE filters rows, HAVING filters groups
- Know the execution order: WHERE → GROUP BY → HAVING
- Understand that WHERE cannot use aggregate functions
- Practice examples that use both clauses together
- Be able to explain performance differences
