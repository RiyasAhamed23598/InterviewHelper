# What are the different types of JOINs in SQL?

## Answer

SQL JOINs are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. Understanding different JOIN types is crucial for effective database querying.

## Sample Tables for Examples

```sql
-- Employees table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    dept_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employees VALUES 
(1, 'John Doe', 10),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 20),
(3, 'Mike Johnson', 10),
(4, 'Sarah Wilson', NULL);

-- Departments table
CREATE TABLE departments (
    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    dept_name VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO departments VALUES 
(10, 'Engineering'),
(20, 'Marketing'),
(30, 'Finance');
```

## 1. INNER JOIN

Returns only rows that have matching values in both tables.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- Result:
-- John Doe     | Engineering
-- Jane Smith   | Marketing  
-- Mike Johnson | Engineering
```

**Use Case**: When you only want records that exist in both tables.

## 2. LEFT JOIN (LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. NULL values for non-matching right table columns.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- Result:
-- John Doe     | Engineering
-- Jane Smith   | Marketing
-- Mike Johnson | Engineering
-- Sarah Wilson | NULL
```

**Use Case**: When you want all records from the main table, regardless of matches.

## 3. RIGHT JOIN (RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. NULL values for non-matching left table columns.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- Result:
-- John Doe     | Engineering
-- Jane Smith   | Marketing
-- Mike Johnson | Engineering
-- NULL         | Finance
```

**Use Case**: Less common, but useful when you want all records from the reference table.

## 4. FULL OUTER JOIN

Returns all rows when there's a match in either table. Shows NULL values where no match exists.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- Result:
-- John Doe     | Engineering
-- Jane Smith   | Marketing
-- Mike Johnson | Engineering
-- Sarah Wilson | NULL
-- NULL         | Finance
```

**Use Case**: When you want to see all records from both tables, including unmatched ones.

## 5. CROSS JOIN

Returns the Cartesian product of both tables (every row from first table combined with every row from second table).

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;

-- Result: 4 employees Ã— 3 departments = 12 rows
-- John Doe     | Engineering
-- John Doe     | Marketing
-- John Doe     | Finance
-- Jane Smith   | Engineering
-- ... (and so on)
```

**Use Case**: Rarely used in practice, mainly for generating test data or specific analytical needs.

## 6. SELF JOIN

A table is joined with itself using aliases.

```sql
-- Example: Find employees and their managers
CREATE TABLE employees_with_manager (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT
);

INSERT INTO employees_with_manager VALUES 
(1, 'John Doe', NULL),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 1),
(3, 'Mike Johnson', 1),
(4, 'Sarah Wilson', 2);

SELECT e.name AS employee, m.name AS manager
FROM employees_with_manager e
LEFT JOIN employees_with_manager m ON e.manager_id = m.emp_id;

-- Result:
-- John Doe     | NULL
-- Jane Smith   | John Doe
-- Mike Johnson | John Doe
-- Sarah Wilson | Jane Smith
```

**Use Case**: When you need to compare rows within the same table or establish hierarchical relationships.

## Visual Representation

```
Table A    Table B
-------    -------
   1          1
   2          3
   3          4

INNER JOIN:     1, 3
LEFT JOIN:      1, 2, 3
RIGHT JOIN:     1, 3, 4
FULL OUTER:     1, 2, 3, 4
```

## Advanced JOIN Examples

### Multiple JOINs:
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name, p.project_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
LEFT JOIN projects p ON e.emp_id = p.assigned_emp_id;
```

### JOIN with Conditions:
```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id
WHERE d.dept_name = 'Engineering';
```

### JOIN with Aggregation:
```sql
SELECT d.dept_name, COUNT(e.emp_id) as employee_count
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.dept_id = e.dept_id
GROUP BY d.dept_name;
```

## Performance Considerations

1. **INNER JOIN** - Generally fastest as it returns fewer rows
2. **LEFT/RIGHT JOIN** - Slower than INNER JOIN due to NULL handling
3. **FULL OUTER JOIN** - Slowest as it processes all rows from both tables
4. **CROSS JOIN** - Can be very slow with large tables (avoid unless necessary)

## Interview Tips

1. **Understand the differences**: Know what each JOIN type returns
2. **Practice with examples**: Work through JOIN scenarios with sample data
3. **Know performance implications**: Understand which JOINs are faster
4. **Visualize results**: Be able to predict JOIN output mentally
5. **Real-world usage**: Know when to use each JOIN type

## Common Interview Questions

- "What's the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?"
- "When would you use a FULL OUTER JOIN?"
- "How do you find records that exist in one table but not another?"
- "What happens when you JOIN on NULL values?"
