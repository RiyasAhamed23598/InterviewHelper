# What are the different types of SQL commands?

## Answer

SQL commands are categorized into five main types based on their functionality and purpose. Each type serves a specific role in database management and operations.

## 1. DDL (Data Definition Language)

**Purpose**: Define and modify database structure and schema.

### Commands:
- **CREATE** - Creates new database objects
- **ALTER** - Modifies existing database objects
- **DROP** - Deletes database objects
- **TRUNCATE** - Removes all data from a table (structure remains)

```sql
-- CREATE examples
CREATE DATABASE company_db;
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    hire_date DATE
);

-- ALTER examples
ALTER TABLE employees ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN first_name VARCHAR(75);

-- DROP examples
DROP TABLE employees;
DROP DATABASE company_db;

-- TRUNCATE example
TRUNCATE TABLE employees; -- Removes all rows, keeps structure
```

## 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

**Purpose**: Manipulate data within existing database objects.

### Commands:
- **INSERT** - Adds new records
- **UPDATE** - Modifies existing records
- **DELETE** - Removes specific records

```sql
-- INSERT examples
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, first_name, last_name, hire_date)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', '2023-01-15');

INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES 
    (2, 'Jane', 'Smith'),
    (3, 'Mike', 'Johnson');

-- UPDATE examples
UPDATE employees 
SET email = 'john.doe@company.com' 
WHERE emp_id = 1;

UPDATE employees 
SET hire_date = '2023-02-01' 
WHERE first_name = 'Jane';

-- DELETE examples
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 3;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE hire_date < '2023-01-01';
```

## 3. DQL (Data Query Language)

**Purpose**: Retrieve and query data from database objects.

### Commands:
- **SELECT** - Retrieves data from one or more tables

```sql
-- Basic SELECT examples
SELECT * FROM employees;
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM employees;
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE hire_date > '2023-01-01';

-- Advanced SELECT with JOINs
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.dept_id;

-- SELECT with aggregation
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_employees FROM employees;
SELECT AVG(salary) as average_salary FROM employees;
```

## 4. DCL (Data Control Language)

**Purpose**: Control access permissions and security.

### Commands:
- **GRANT** - Provides specific privileges to users
- **REVOKE** - Removes specific privileges from users

```sql
-- GRANT examples
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO user1;
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO user2;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON company_db.* TO admin_user;

-- REVOKE examples
REVOKE INSERT ON employees FROM user2;
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON company_db.* FROM admin_user;
```

## 5. TCL (Transaction Control Language)

**Purpose**: Manage database transactions and ensure data integrity.

### Commands:
- **BEGIN/START TRANSACTION** - Starts a new transaction
- **COMMIT** - Saves all changes made in the current transaction
- **ROLLBACK** - Undoes all changes made in the current transaction
- **SAVEPOINT** - Creates a point within a transaction to rollback to

```sql
-- Transaction example
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (4, 'Sarah', 'Wilson');

SAVEPOINT sp1;

UPDATE employees SET email = 'sarah.wilson@company.com' WHERE emp_id = 4;

-- If something goes wrong, rollback to savepoint
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

-- Or commit all changes
COMMIT;
```

## Command Categories Summary

| Category | Purpose | Key Commands | When to Use |
|----------|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **DDL** | Structure Definition | CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE | Database design, schema changes |
| **DML** | Data Manipulation | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE | Daily data operations |
| **DQL** | Data Querying | SELECT | Data retrieval and reporting |
| **DCL** | Access Control | GRANT, REVOKE | Security and user management |
| **TCL** | Transaction Control | COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT | Data integrity and consistency |

## Interview Tips

1. **Remember the acronyms**: DDL, DML, DQL, DCL, TCL
2. **Understand the purpose**: Each category serves a specific database function
3. **Know the commands**: Memorize the main commands in each category
4. **Practice examples**: Be able to write basic examples for each command type
5. **Understand relationships**: Know how these commands work together in database operations

## Common Interview Questions

- "What's the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?"
- "When would you use ROLLBACK vs COMMIT?"
- "What permissions does GRANT provide?"
- "How do DDL and DML commands differ?"
