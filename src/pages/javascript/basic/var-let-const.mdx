# Explain the difference between var, let, and const.

JavaScript provides three different keywords for declaring variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`. Each has distinct behaviors regarding scope, hoisting, and reassignment capabilities, which impact how we write and structure our code.

## Overview of Differences

| Feature | `var` | `let` | `const` |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| Scope | Function-scoped | Block-scoped | Block-scoped |
| Hoisting | Hoisted with `undefined` | Hoisted but in TDZ* | Hoisted but in TDZ* |
| Reassignment | Allowed | Allowed | Not allowed |
| Redeclaration | Allowed | Not allowed in same scope | Not allowed in same scope |
| Global property | Creates property on `window` | Does not create property on `window` | Does not create property on `window` |

*TDZ = Temporal Dead Zone

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Scope

**`var`** is function-scoped, meaning it's only limited to the function it's declared in:

```javascript
function scopeTest() {
  var functionScoped = "I'm function scoped";
  
  if (true) {
    var alsoFunctionScoped = "I'm also function scoped";
  }
  
  console.log(functionScoped);      // "I'm function scoped"
  console.log(alsoFunctionScoped);  // "I'm also function scoped"
}

scopeTest();
console.log(functionScoped);        // ReferenceError: functionScoped is not defined
```

**`let`** and **`const`** are block-scoped, meaning they're limited to the block, statement, or expression they're declared in:

```javascript
function scopeTest() {
  let blockScoped = "I'm block scoped";
  const alsoBlockScoped = "I'm also block scoped";
  
  if (true) {
    let insideBlock = "I only exist in this block";
    const alsoInsideBlock = "I also only exist in this block";
    
    console.log(blockScoped);       // "I'm block scoped"
    console.log(insideBlock);       // "I only exist in this block"
  }
  
  console.log(blockScoped);         // "I'm block scoped"
  console.log(insideBlock);         // ReferenceError: insideBlock is not defined
}
```

### 2. Hoisting

All declarations (`var`, `let`, and `const`) are hoisted in JavaScript, but they behave differently:

**`var`** declarations are initialized with `undefined`:

```javascript
console.log(hoistedVar);  // undefined
var hoistedVar = "I'm hoisted but initialized later";
```

**`let`** and **`const`** declarations are hoisted but not initialized, creating a "Temporal Dead Zone" where accessing them before declaration throws an error:

```javascript
console.log(hoistedLet);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'hoistedLet' before initialization
let hoistedLet = "I'm hoisted but not accessible";

console.log(hoistedConst);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'hoistedConst' before initialization
const hoistedConst = "I'm also hoisted but not accessible";
```

### 3. Reassignment

**`var`** and **`let`** allow reassignment:

```javascript
var count = 1;
count = 2;  // Valid

let score = 10;
score = 20;  // Valid
```

**`const`** does not allow reassignment:

```javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
PI = 3;  // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

// However, for objects and arrays, the contents can be modified:
const user = { name: "Rahul" };
user.name = "Priya";  // Valid - the object's properties can be changed
user = { name: "Amit" };  // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.push(4);  // Valid - the array can be modified
numbers = [5, 6];  // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable
```

### 4. Redeclaration

**`var`** allows redeclaration in the same scope:

```javascript
var message = "Hello";
var message = "World";  // Valid, message is now "World"
```

**`let`** and **`const`** do not allow redeclaration in the same scope:

```javascript
let user = "Rahul";
let user = "Priya";  // SyntaxError: Identifier 'user' has already been declared

const API_KEY = "abc123";
const API_KEY = "xyz789";  // SyntaxError: Identifier 'API_KEY' has already been declared
```

### 5. Global Object Property

**`var`** declarations in the global scope become properties of the global object (`window` in browsers):

```javascript
var globalVar = "I'm a global variable";
console.log(window.globalVar);  // "I'm a global variable"
```

**`let`** and **`const`** declarations do not create properties on the global object:

```javascript
let globalLet = "I'm not on the global object";
const globalConst = "Neither am I";

console.log(window.globalLet);    // undefined
console.log(window.globalConst);  // undefined
```

## Best Practices

### When to use `var`

Generally, `var` should be avoided in modern JavaScript code except when:
- Supporting legacy browsers without transpilation
- Needing function-scoped variables with specific hoisting behaviors

### When to use `let`

Use `let` when:
- The variable's value needs to change over time
- Working with loop counters
- Implementing state that changes

```javascript
let counter = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  counter += i;
}
```

### When to use `const`

Use `const` by default for:
- Values that shouldn't be reassigned
- Object and array references (even if their contents will change)
- Function declarations
- Import statements
- Configuration values

```javascript
const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com/v1';
const fetchData = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/data`);
  return response.json();
};
```

This example demonstrates:
1. Using `const` for values that should never change (tax rate, thresholds)
2. Using `let` for variables that need reassignment (subtotal, discount, shipping)
3. Using `const` in loops to prevent accidental reassignment of the current item
4. Legacy code using `var` (which could be refactored)

## Temporal Dead Zone Explained

The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior specific to `let` and `const` declarations. It's the period between entering a scope where a variable is declared and the actual declaration:

```javascript
{
  // TDZ starts for x
  const y = 20;
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 10;     // TDZ ends for x
}
```

This behavior helps catch errors where variables are used before they're properly initialized.

## Interview Tips

- Emphasize that you default to `const` unless you need reassignment, then use `let`
- Explain that `var` is mostly avoided in modern code due to its function scope and hoisting behavior
- Be prepared to discuss the Temporal Dead Zone and how it differs from hoisting with `var`
- Mention that while `const` prevents reassignment, it doesn't make objects immutable
- Discuss how block scoping with `let` and `const` helps prevent common bugs and makes code more predictable
- Share specific examples of when you'd use each declaration type in real-world code
