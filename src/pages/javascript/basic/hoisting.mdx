# What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Hoisting is a JavaScript behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, before the code is executed. This means that regardless of where declarations appear in your code, they are conceptually "moved" to the top of their scope, which affects how the code behaves when it runs.

## How Hoisting Works

JavaScript processes code in two phases:
1. **Compilation Phase**: Declarations are processed and allocated in memory
2. **Execution Phase**: Code is executed line by line

During the compilation phase, the JavaScript engine:
- Recognizes all variable and function declarations
- Allocates memory for them
- Initializes variables depending on their declaration type

## Variable Hoisting

### `var` Declarations

Variables declared with `var` are hoisted and initialized with `undefined`:

```javascript
console.log(name); // undefined (not a ReferenceError)
var name = "Rahul";

// The above code behaves as if written:
var name; // Declaration is hoisted
console.log(name); // undefined
name = "Rahul"; // Assignment stays in place
```

### `let` and `const` Declarations

Variables declared with `let` and `const` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. They remain in a "Temporal Dead Zone" (TDZ) until their declaration is reached:

```javascript
console.log(age); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'age' before initialization
let age = 30;

console.log(API_KEY); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'API_KEY' before initialization
const API_KEY = "abc123";
```

## Function Hoisting

### Function Declarations

Function declarations are completely hoisted with their body:

```javascript
// This works because the function declaration is hoisted
sayHello(); // "Hello, world!"

function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

### Function Expressions

Function expressions are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations:

```javascript
// This throws an error because only the variable declaration is hoisted, not the function assignment
sayGoodbye(); // TypeError: sayGoodbye is not a function

var sayGoodbye = function() {
  console.log("Goodbye, world!");
};

// The above code behaves as if written:
var sayGoodbye; // Declaration is hoisted and initialized as undefined
sayGoodbye(); // TypeError: undefined is not a function
sayGoodbye = function() { // Assignment stays in place
  console.log("Goodbye, world!");
};
```

### Arrow Functions

Arrow functions behave like function expressions regarding hoisting:

```javascript
greet(); // TypeError: greet is not a function

var greet = () => {
  console.log("Greetings!");
};
```

## Class Hoisting

Classes behave similarly to `let` and `const` declarations:

```javascript
// ReferenceError: Cannot access 'User' before initialization
const user = new User("Rahul", "Sharma");

class User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }
}
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Variable and Function Hoisting Interaction

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log(x); // undefined (not ReferenceError)
  
  var x = 10;
  
  console.log(x); // 10
  
  function innerFunc() {
    console.log(x); // 10 (accesses x from outer scope)
    
    var y = 20;
    
    console.log(y); // 20
  }
  
  innerFunc();
  
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined (y is scoped to innerFunc)
}

example();
```

### Example 2: Function Declaration vs. Expression

```javascript
// Function declaration - fully hoisted
declaration(); // "I am a function declaration"

function declaration() {
  console.log("I am a function declaration");
}

// Function expression - only variable is hoisted
expression(); // TypeError: expression is not a function

var expression = function() {
  console.log("I am a function expression");
};
```

### Example 3: Block Scope and Hoisting

```javascript
var x = 1;

{
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before initialization
  let x = 2;
}
```

In this example, the `let x` declaration in the block creates a new block-scoped variable that shadows the outer `x`. The inner `x` is hoisted within the block but is in the TDZ until its declaration.

## Common Hoisting Pitfalls

### Pitfall 1: Assuming Declarations Aren't Hoisted

```javascript
function getName() {
  console.log(name); // undefined, not ReferenceError
  
  if (false) {
    var name = "Rahul"; // Hoisted to function scope
  }
  
  return name;
}

console.log(getName()); // undefined
```

### Pitfall 2: Forgetting That Function Expressions Aren't Fully Hoisted

```javascript
function setup() {
  init(); // TypeError: init is not a function
  
  var init = function() {
    console.log("Initializing...");
  };
}

setup();
```

### Pitfall 3: Redeclarations with `var`

```javascript
var counter = 1;

function increment() {
  console.log(counter); // undefined, not 1
  
  var counter = counter + 1; // counter is undefined here
  
  console.log(counter); // NaN (undefined + 1)
}

increment();
```

## Best Practices to Avoid Hoisting Issues

1. **Declare variables at the top of their scope**
   ```javascript
   function example() {
     var a = 1;
     var b = 2;
     var c = 3;
     
     // Rest of the function...
   }
   ```

2. **Use `let` and `const` instead of `var`**
   ```javascript
   // Block-scoped variables help avoid many hoisting issues
   function example() {
     const PI = 3.14159;
     let count = 0;
     
     // Rest of the function...
   }
   ```

3. **Always declare variables before using them**
   ```javascript
   // Bad
   x = 5;
   var x;
   
   // Good
   let x;
   x = 5;
   ```

4. **Use function declarations when you need to call them before their definition**
   ```javascript
   // This is fine because of hoisting
   doSomething();
   
   function doSomething() {
     console.log("Task completed");
   }
   ```

5. **Be consistent with your function style**
   ```javascript
   // Either use all declarations
   function add(a, b) { return a + b; }
   function subtract(a, b) { return a - b; }
   
   // Or all expressions (with let/const)
   const add = (a, b) => a + b;
   const subtract = (a, b) => a - b;
   ```

## Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) Explained

The Temporal Dead Zone is the period between entering a scope where a variable is declared with `let` or `const` and the actual declaration line:

```javascript
{
  // TDZ starts for x
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError
  
  let x = 10; // TDZ ends for x
  
  console.log(x); // 10
}
```

The TDZ exists to catch programming errors and enforce better coding practices by ensuring variables are declared before they're used.

## Hoisting in Modern JavaScript

With the introduction of ES6 and later versions, JavaScript development practices have evolved:

- Modern JavaScript favors `let` and `const` over `var`
- Block scoping helps prevent many hoisting-related issues
- Linters and static analysis tools can catch potential hoisting problems
- Strict mode (`"use strict"`) helps identify undeclared variables

## Interview Tips

- Explain that hoisting is about the order of processing declarations, not physically moving code
- Distinguish between declaration hoisting and initialization
- Highlight the differences in hoisting behavior between `var`, `let`, and `const`
- Explain the Temporal Dead Zone concept for `let` and `const`
- Describe the difference between function declarations and expressions regarding hoisting
- Mention best practices to avoid hoisting-related bugs
- Be prepared to write code examples that demonstrate hoisting behavior
