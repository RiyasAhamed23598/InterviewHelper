# What are the different types of assemblies in .NET?

In .NET, an assembly is the fundamental unit of deployment, version control, reuse, and security. It is a compiled code library typically stored as an EXE or DLL file that contains IL (Intermediate Language) code, metadata, and resources.

## Assembly Classification

.NET assemblies can be categorized in several ways:

### 1. By File Type

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Executable (.exe)** | Contains entry point (Main method) | `MyApp.exe` |
| **Library (.dll)** | Reusable code without entry point | `MyLibrary.dll` |

```csharp
// Executable assembly with entry point
public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

### 2. By Accessibility

| Type | Description | Access |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Private Assembly** | Used by a single application | Application directory |
| **Shared Assembly** | Used by multiple applications | Global Assembly Cache (GAC) |

```csharp
// Private assembly reference
<Reference Include="PrivateLibrary" />

// Shared assembly reference (strong-named, in GAC)
<Reference Include="SharedLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089" />
```

### 3. By Creation Method

| Type | Description | Use Case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Static Assembly** | Created at compile time | Normal application development |
| **Dynamic Assembly** | Created at runtime | Code generation, reflection |

```csharp
// Creating a dynamic assembly at runtime
AssemblyName assemblyName = new AssemblyName("DynamicAssembly");
AssemblyBuilder assemblyBuilder = AssemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicAssembly(
    assemblyName, AssemblyBuilderAccess.Run);
```

### 4. By Composition

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Single-file Assembly** | All code in one file | Small libraries |
| **Multi-file Assembly** | Code split across files | Large frameworks |

```csharp
// Creating a multi-file assembly (using compiler options)
csc /target:library /out:MyAssembly.dll File1.cs File2.cs
```

### 5. By Reference Type

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Strongly Named** | Digitally signed with a key | `System.Data.dll` |
| **Regular** | Not digitally signed | Simple application libraries |

```csharp
// Strong naming an assembly
[assembly: AssemblyKeyFile("MyKey.snk")]

// In modern .NET projects
<PropertyGroup>
  <SignAssembly>true</SignAssembly>
  <AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile>MyKey.snk</AssemblyOriginatorKeyFile>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## Assembly Structure

Every .NET assembly contains:

1. **Assembly Manifest**: Metadata about the assembly (version, dependencies)
2. **Type Metadata**: Information about types defined in the assembly
3. **IL Code**: Compiled code in Intermediate Language format
4. **Resources**: Embedded files (images, strings, etc.)

## Assembly Loading

Assemblies are loaded into the CLR using different strategies:

- **Load-by-name**: CLR searches for the assembly in predefined locations
- **Explicit loading**: Using `Assembly.Load()` or `Assembly.LoadFrom()`
- **Reflection-only loading**: For inspection without execution

```csharp
// Explicitly loading an assembly
Assembly assembly = Assembly.LoadFrom("MyLibrary.dll");

// Creating an instance from a loaded assembly
Type type = assembly.GetType("MyLibrary.MyClass");
object instance = Activator.CreateInstance(type);
```

## Modern .NET Assembly Considerations

In .NET Core and .NET 5+:

- **No GAC**: Shared assemblies use NuGet packages instead
- **Self-contained deployment**: All dependencies included with the app
- **Assembly trimming**: Unused parts can be removed
- **Single-file applications**: All assemblies bundled into one executable
