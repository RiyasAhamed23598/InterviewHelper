# What is the difference between .NET Framework and .NET Core?

.NET Framework is the original Windows-only implementation of .NET, while .NET Core (now continued as .NET 5+) is the modern, cross-platform, open-source reimagining of .NET. Both share common principles but differ significantly in design, capabilities, and use cases.

## Evolution Timeline

| Year | Release |
|------|---------|
| 2002 | .NET Framework 1.0 |
| 2016 | .NET Core 1.0 |
| 2020 | .NET 5 (unification) |
| 2023 | .NET 8 (LTS) |

## Key Differences

| Feature | .NET Framework | .NET Core/.NET 5+ |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Platform Support** | Windows only | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS) |
| **Open Source** | Partially open source | Fully open source |
| **Deployment** | System-wide installation | Self-contained or framework-dependent |
| **Updates** | Tied to Windows updates | Independent release cycle |
| **Performance** | Good | Better (optimized for modern workloads) |
| **Container Support** | Limited | Excellent (optimized for containers) |
| **Future Development** | Maintenance mode only | Active development |

## Architecture Differences

### .NET Framework
- Monolithic framework installed system-wide
- Tightly coupled with Windows OS
- Single, large runtime and framework

### .NET Core/.NET 5+
- Modular architecture with NuGet packages
- Decoupled from the operating system
- Smaller, composable framework components

## Component Support

### Exclusive to .NET Framework
- Windows Forms (now available in .NET Core 3.0+)
- WPF (now available in .NET Core 3.0+)
- ASP.NET Web Forms (not ported)
- WCF Server (not fully ported)
- .NET Remoting (not ported)

### Exclusive to .NET Core/.NET 5+
- Blazor WebAssembly
- Native AOT compilation
- Enhanced performance APIs (`Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`)
- Built-in dependency injection
- Improved configuration system

## Migration Path

.NET Framework applications can be migrated to .NET using:
- The .NET Upgrade Assistant tool
- Side-by-side migration approach
- Shared code libraries targeting .NET Standard

```csharp
// .NET Standard library that works with both
<PropertyGroup>
  <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>
</PropertyGroup>
```

## When to Choose Each

### Choose .NET Framework for:
- Existing applications that work well
- Windows-only applications using unsupported technologies
- Applications using third-party libraries without .NET Core support

### Choose .NET Core/.NET 5+ for:
- New application development
- Cross-platform requirements
- Microservices and containerized applications
- Performance-critical applications
- Cloud-native applications

## Future Direction

Microsoft has unified the .NET platform with .NET 5 and beyond, which continues the cross-platform focus of .NET Core while incorporating the best of .NET Framework. .NET Framework will continue to be supported but will not receive new features.
