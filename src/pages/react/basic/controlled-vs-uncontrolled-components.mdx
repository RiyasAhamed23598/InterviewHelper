# What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?

In React, form elements such as `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and `<select>` maintain their own state and update it based on user input. When dealing with these elements, developers have two approaches: controlled components and uncontrolled components. The key difference lies in how the form data is handled - whether React controls it or the DOM controls it.

## Controlled Components

Controlled components are those where React completely controls the state of the form elements. The component's state becomes the "single source of truth" for the input value.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ControlledForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  const [message, setMessage] = useState('');
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('Form submitted with:', { name, email, message });
    // Process form data...
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          id="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea
          id="message"
          value={message}
          onChange={(e) => setMessage(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Key Characteristics of Controlled Components:

1. **React manages the state**: The component's state serves as the "single source of truth"
2. **Value attribute**: Form elements have a `value` prop set (or `checked` for checkboxes and radio buttons)
3. **Event handlers**: Changes are handled through event handlers like `onChange`
4. **Immediate access to input values**: You can access the current value of the input at any time
5. **Input validation**: You can perform validation on every keystroke

## Uncontrolled Components

Uncontrolled components are those where the form data is handled by the DOM itself. Instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from 'react';

function UncontrolledForm() {
  const nameRef = useRef(null);
  const emailRef = useRef(null);
  const messageRef = useRef(null);
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const formData = {
      name: nameRef.current.value,
      email: emailRef.current.value,
      message: messageRef.current.value
    };
    
    console.log('Form submitted with:', formData);
    // Process form data...
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          ref={nameRef}
          defaultValue="Rahul" // Optional initial value
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          id="email"
          ref={emailRef}
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="message">Message:</label>
        <textarea
          id="message"
          ref={messageRef}
        />
      </div>
      
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Key Characteristics of Uncontrolled Components:

1. **DOM manages the state**: The form element maintains its own state
2. **Refs**: You use refs to access the current values of form elements
3. **defaultValue**: Instead of `value`, you use `defaultValue` for initial values (or `defaultChecked` for checkboxes and radio buttons)
4. **Less code**: Often requires less code for simple forms
5. **Values accessed on submit**: You typically access form values when the form is submitted

## Comparison Table

| Feature | Controlled Components | Uncontrolled Components |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Source of truth | Component state | DOM |
| Value access | Anytime via state | On-demand via refs |
| Value setting | Through state updates | Through `defaultValue` or DOM manipulation |
| Input validation | Immediate (on change) | Typically on submit |
| Code complexity | More code, more explicit | Less code, more implicit |
| Form reset | Reset state values | Use DOM API (form.reset()) |
| Dynamic inputs | Easier to implement | More complex |
| Testing | Easier to test | More challenging |

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Controlled Components When:

1. You need immediate validation feedback
2. You want to conditionally disable the submit button
3. You need to enforce input formats (e.g., credit card formatting)
4. You're building dynamic forms where fields change based on user input
5. You need to submit the form programmatically
6. You want more predictable and testable code

### Use Uncontrolled Components When:

1. You're integrating with non-React code
2. You're building simple forms with minimal validation
3. You're working with large forms where performance might be a concern
4. You're using file inputs (which are inherently uncontrolled)
5. You're converting a legacy application to React

## File Inputs - A Special Case

File inputs (`<input type="file">`) are inherently uncontrolled in React because their value can only be set by a user, not programmatically due to security reasons.

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useState } from 'react';

function FileUploadForm() {
  const fileInputRef = useRef(null);
  const [fileName, setFileName] = useState('No file chosen');
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const file = fileInputRef.current.files[0];
    console.log('Selected file:', file);
    // Process file upload...
  };
  
  const handleFileChange = (e) => {
    const file = e.target.files[0];
    setFileName(file ? file.name : 'No file chosen');
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="file">Choose file:</label>
        <input
          type="file"
          id="file"
          ref={fileInputRef}
          onChange={handleFileChange}
        />
        <span>{fileName}</span>
      </div>
      
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

## Hybrid Approach

Sometimes, you might want to use both approaches in the same form:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useRef } from 'react';

function HybridForm() {
  // Controlled components
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
  
  // Uncontrolled component
  const fileInputRef = useRef(null);
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    const formData = {
      name,
      email,
      file: fileInputRef.current.files[0]
    };
    
    console.log('Form submitted with:', formData);
    // Process form data...
  };
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="name">Name:</label>
        <input
          type="text"
          id="name"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="email">Email:</label>
        <input
          type="email"
          id="email"
          value={email}
          onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}
        />
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="file">File:</label>
        <input
          type="file"
          id="file"
          ref={fileInputRef}
        />
      </div>
      
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
