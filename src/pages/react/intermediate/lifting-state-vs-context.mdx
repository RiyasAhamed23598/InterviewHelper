# Lifting State Up vs Context API

## What is Lifting State Up?

Lifting state up is a pattern in React where state is moved from a child component to its parent component to share that state with sibling components. This approach follows React's unidirectional data flow principle.

```jsx
function Parent() {
  // State is lifted up to the parent
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <div>
      <ChildA count={count} setCount={setCount} />
      <ChildB count={count} />
    </div>
  );
}

function ChildA({ count, setCount }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Increment: {count}
    </button>
  );
}

function ChildB({ count }) {
  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
}
```

## What is Context API?

Context API is a React feature that allows you to share state across the component tree without passing props manually at every level. It's designed to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components.

```jsx
// Create a context
const CountContext = React.createContext();

function CountProvider({ children }) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={{ count, setCount }}>
      {children}
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
}

function App() {
  return (
    <CountProvider>
      <div>
        <ChildA />
        <ChildB />
      </div>
    </CountProvider>
  );
}

function ChildA() {
  const { count, setCount } = useContext(CountContext);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Increment: {count}
    </button>
  );
}

function ChildB() {
  const { count } = useContext(CountContext);
  
  return <div>Count: {count}</div>;
}
```

## Key Differences

### 1. Explicitness vs Implicitness

**Lifting State Up:**
- Explicit data flow through props
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Easy to trace where data comes from

**Context API:**
- Implicit data flow
- Components can consume context without parent awareness
- Can be harder to trace data sources

### 2. Component Coupling

**Lifting State Up:**
- Tightly couples parent and child components
- Changes to parent state affect all children directly
- Components are less reusable independently

**Context API:**
- Loosely couples components
- Components can be used in different contexts
- Better separation of concerns

### 3. Performance Considerations

**Lifting State Up:**
- Can cause unnecessary re-renders in intermediate components
- Prop changes trigger re-renders down the tree
- More predictable rendering behavior

**Context API:**
- Can optimize rendering with proper memoization
- Only components that consume context re-render
- Potential for performance issues if context value changes frequently

### 4. Code Organization

**Lifting State Up:**
- Keeps related state and handlers together
- Simpler for smaller component trees
- Can lead to prop drilling in deeper trees

**Context API:**
- Separates state from UI components
- Better for global or widely-used state
- Reduces component complexity

## When to Use Each Approach

### Use Lifting State Up When:

1. Sharing state between a few closely related components
2. The component tree is relatively shallow
3. You want to maintain clear data flow
4. The state is specific to a particular UI section
5. You want to avoid the complexity of Context

```jsx
// Good use case for lifting state up
function SearchableList() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <SearchBar query={query} setQuery={setQuery} />
      <ResultsList query={query} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Use Context API When:

1. Sharing state across many components at different nesting levels
2. The component tree is deep
3. You want to avoid prop drilling
4. The state is truly global (themes, user data, language preferences)
5. You need to separate state management from UI components

```jsx
// Good use case for Context API
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <UserProvider>
        <Layout>
          <Sidebar />
          <MainContent>
            <Dashboard />
          </MainContent>
        </Layout>
      </UserProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Combining Both Approaches

In real applications, you'll often use both approaches:

```jsx
// Using both approaches together
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
        <Dashboard />
      </UserContext.Provider>
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Dashboard() {
  // Local state lifted up within Dashboard
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('overview');
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Tabs activeTab={activeTab} setActiveTab={setActiveTab} />
      <TabContent activeTab={activeTab} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start with lifting state up** for simpler cases
2. **Introduce Context** when prop drilling becomes problematic
3. **Keep Context focused** on specific domains (theme, auth, etc.)
4. **Memoize Context values** to prevent unnecessary re-renders
5. **Split Context providers** instead of having one giant context

## Interview Tips

- Explain that both approaches solve the same problem (sharing state) but in different ways
- Discuss the trade-offs in terms of explicitness, performance, and maintainability
- Mention that modern React applications typically use both approaches where appropriate
- Demonstrate understanding of when each approach is most suitable
- Explain how Context API is not a complete state management solution by itself
- Discuss how hooks like useReducer can enhance both approaches
